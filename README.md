# Take-notes
  
This is an Express-powered note taking app.  
Users can write a new note by clicking the "+" icon on the top right of the notes page.  
From there, they can input a valid title and text, then by clicking the save button, notes will be seen on the left column.  
It is then possible to edit, delete and/or create more notes.
